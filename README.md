To test it out, tap in the top text view and drag the caret down below the last line. The UIVariableDelayLoupeGesture that is in progress will be moved to the bottom view. This is not working because the view associated with the gesture cannot be changed and is still the top view.

I seriously doubt what I'm trying to do here is possible in UIKit.
